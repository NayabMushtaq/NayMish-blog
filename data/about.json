  "text": "Hey, I’m the person behind NayMish.\n\nI’m not here to teach from a distance. I’m still learning. This blog is my notebook of thoughts, experiences, mistakes, lessons, and ideas I'm exploring.\n\nGrowth, for me, doesn’t happen in big dramatic ways. It happens quietly — while staying consistent even when things are hard.\n\nHere, I share what I’m learning, what I’m struggling with, and the slow progress I make.\n\nWelcome to NayMish.",
